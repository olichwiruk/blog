Have you ever had to make extra changes just because of misunderstanding with your teammates about endpoint or parameter name? If so, this is how OpenAPI can prevent your team from such a waste of time.

## What OpenAPI is?

> The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection.

## Define your API first

With OpanAPI you can clearly discuss definition of your REST API.
Which endpoint name is the best. What parameters it needs. What the response's structure will look like.

Defining endpoints is decoupled from implementation, so changes are easy and fast. It makes prototyping API cheep and allows focusing on a semantic - which is the most important.

## Documentation

Last, but not least - you have already documented provided endpoints. You can even add UI with tools like [Swagger](https://swagger.io/).

It's like writing tests first approach, but on an architecturally higher level.



As you can see, using OpenAPI in your workflow can bring lots of benefits to you and your team. Do you have any thoughts? Write them down in a comments' section!
