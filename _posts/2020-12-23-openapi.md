How openapi can prevent your team from waste of time.

Pros:
* e2e tests for (almost) free
* communication protocol about common API
* Application agnostic
* api doc + swagger
* source of truth about API is decoupled from implementations
* contract between backend and frontend

Cons:
* need to be done
